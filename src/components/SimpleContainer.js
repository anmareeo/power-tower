<p>Rock legend Tom Petty wasn't the first, but he expressed it well when he sang, "the waiting is the hardest part."                
               If you own a construction business, especially a smaller one, you know the agony of the waitingâ€”that tension between your bid submission and the much needed news that will change your tune to something more like Working Man by Rush. 
               <br></br>
               When you win that project, you breath a sigh of relief, and then prepare for the next set of challenges that come with building the project.
               <br></br>
                
                <br></br>
                At Digital Defense Surveillance, the construction site is where we really shine, but we can also give you a little extra boost of power that just might ensure that the construction site we guard is yours.
